# Basement Audio Site

The Basement Audio site is a small-business website created as a favor for a friend. It is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using the [Sapper framework](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper), which is a static site generator for Svelte apps. For styling it uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) with PostCSS to remove unused utility classes.

I never had the intention of sharing this as a model project so I wouldn't rank the code-quality particularly high, but overall I don't think it's *too* embarrassing. Plus, Svelte is a pretty neat framework that not a lot of people are familiar with!

To boot up the dev server just run: 

```
yarn dev
```
