Kipani,Singer/Songwriter,Kipani.jpg,"Dave is awesome to work with, and a true master of his craft. He helps bring your vision to fruition while still challenging you as an artist. Working with Dave has allowed me to break boundaries I never knew existed, and I have become a better musician because of it. Contact Basement Audio for your next project, you won't be sorry!"
Pat Donnelly,Singer/Songwriter,Pat-Donnelly.jpg,"Basement Audio is a great, professional studio for recording your music or demo the way you want it to sound. Dave makes the process fun and efficient to get the finished recording in your hand quickly. Because he's such a talented musician, he provides great input and recommendations throughout the session."
Felicia Mitchell,Singer,Felcia-Mitchell.jpg,"I found Basement Audio about a year ago after having tried other local studios. Dave with BA is hands down the best guy to work with. As a vocalist, I really appreciate being able to go into a studio and not just have someone run the sound but also to invest themselves in the process. Dave does that. He won't quit until it's perfect. I've had nothing but the greatest experiences at Basement Audio. I would encourage anyone looking to record to look no further."
Tyler Fedoris,Singer/Guitarist of Hillcrest,Tyler-Fedoris.jpg,"My band is on its third attempt now at recording our debut album and this time, we decided to take it to Basement Audio. After only a couple weeks of working with Dave, we can already tell that this will be our final attempt. Clearly having a lot of passion in his work, he makes us feel like our project means just as much to him as it does to us. That goes a long way, and if you're willing to put the time and energy into it, Dave can make your music sound like anything you want it to be. We wish we had found Basement Audio sooner and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for high quality work for such a fair price. We will definitely be returning for future projects."
